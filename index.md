# Data Description
  The main dataset will be information collected to generate a genome-scale constraint-based model to elucidate cellular interactions between organisms. Sampling of aqueous medium and bioreactor headspace will provide data that the model will use. Code is also necessary to create and structure the model. Organisms investigated include various algal and microbial species or combined algal-bacterial cultures. 
# Roles and responsibilities
  In my research group, the most authoritative person will oversee implementing and following the DMP; in my case this is my advisor/PI for the project. Because there are also various collaborators, the individual lab groups may have a slightly different plan, but everyone involved in this project will be aware and understand an overarching DMP. This might take some discussion, but I think it would be most beneficial to the project if everyone agreed on an overarching DMP for all information being shared between collaborators. For my research group (myself and my advisor), my PI will implement the plan and oversee the research activities. As the grad student, I will be responsible for data collection, data organization, metadata generation, and instrumentation and control. I think it would be beneficial for my PI and I to assess quality control together and we will both be building models from our software. I imagine before various research groups collaborate with my advisor and I, we have an agreement about access, storage, and dissemination of our work. It is my belief that all contributors support placing our large datasets in a data repository. 
# Data standards and metadata
  
# Storage and security
  Every day data will be stored in XLSX through automatic sampling so lots of data will be generated. Files are to be stored on a computer and external hard drive (for safety). Models will be built with software python and MATLAB, stored in GitHub, and downloaded and saved to computer/external hard drive.Important breakthroughs in the research will be shared through zoom meetings and email. Once a paper is in progress, a shared Box will be used by all contributors; access will be granted through a 2-step authentication.
# Access and data sharing
  All collaborators will have access to necessary materials throughout the project. The genome data and metabolic models will be publicly available for use and re-use and will be accessible when a manuscript is published. Data is available in the Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID). data content is distributed through the creative commons international license. 
# Archiving and preservation
All data will be archived for the lifetime that the manuscript is available online (assume indefinitely).
