# Data Description
# Roles and responsibilities
  In my research group, the most authoritative person will oversee implementing and following the DMP; in my case this is my advisor/PI for the project. Because there are also various collaborators, the individual lab groups may have a slightly different plan, but everyone involved in this project will be aware and understand an overarching DMP. This might take some discussion, but I think it would be most beneficial to the project if everyone agreed on an overarching DMP for all information being shared between collaborators. For my research group (myself and my advisor), my PI will implement the plan and oversee the research activities. As the grad student, I will be responsible for data collection, data organization, metadata generation, and instrumentation and control. I think it would be beneficial for my PI and I to assess quality control together and we will both be building models from our software. I imagine before various research groups collaborate with my advisor and I, we have an agreement about access, storage, and dissemination of our work. It is my belief that all contributors support placing our large datasets in a data repository. 
# Data standards and metadata
  
# Storage and security
  Every day data will be stored in excel files through automatic sampling so lots of data will be generated. Excel files are to be stored on a computer and external hard drive (for safety). Models will be built with software python and MATLAB, stored in software, and downloaded and saved to computer/external hard drive. For me, there is an important component of saving data and work to my personal laptop as well as using my grad desktop in my office. Important breakthroughs in the research will be shared through zoom meetings and email. Once a paper is in progress, I think it would be beneficial to have a shared document that each person contributes to; access will be granted through a 2-step authentication and the PI will send out the link to the shared document to the project contributors only. 
# Access and data sharing
  All collaborators will have access to necessary materials throughut the project. The genome data will eventually be publicly available for use and re-use. 
# Archiving and preservation
